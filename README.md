Of course. This is the perfect time to create the public-facing README.md. It will serve as the front door to your project, explaining what it is and how to use it, while the CHARTER.md remains your internal strategic guide.

A minimalist Fantasy Premier League dashboard for the busy fan. Get the insights you need to make your weekly transfer decisions in under 60 seconds.

---

## The Problem

Are you a "Busy Fan"? You love playing FPL with your friends and colleagues, but you don't have hours to spend on research every week. You find yourself juggling five different browser tabs‚Äîchecking fixtures, injury news, and predicted lineups‚Äîonly to get overwhelmed. This "analysis paralysis" often leads to missed deadlines and disengagement from the game.

## The Solution: ViewXI

**ViewXI** is a single-page dashboard that solves the "5-Tab Problem." It synthesizes the most critical data points onto one clean screen, allowing you to make a smart, informed decision in a fraction of the time.

### Core Features (MVP)

*   **Single-View Dashboard:** Enter your FPL Team ID and instantly see your full squad.
*   **Fixture Difficulty:** A simple color-coded system (üü¢ Easy, üü° Medium, üî¥ Hard) shows the strength of your players' next opponents.
*   **Fitness Status:** Clear icons (‚úÖ Fit, üü° Doubt, ‚ùå Out) let you know who is ready for the match.
*   **Start Certainty:** A unique proxy based on recent minutes played (üî• Nailed On, üòê Rotation Risk, ‚ùÑÔ∏è Bench Player) helps you avoid players who won't be on the pitch.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Git
*   Python 3.10+
*   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (The project's package manager)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/view-xi.git
    cd view-xi
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the venv
    uv venv

    # Activate it (Linux/macOS)
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project uses `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies. `uv sync` will install the exact versions from the `uv.lock` file.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    This command starts the FastAPI development server. The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server when you make changes to the code.
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

5.  **View the application:**
    Open the `frontend/index.html` file directly in your browser to see the user interface.

## How to Use

Once the server is running and you've opened the frontend:

1.  Find your FPL Team ID from the FPL website.
2.  Enter it into the input box on the ViewXI homepage.
3.  Click "Go" and instantly see your dashboard.

## Project Status

This project is currently an MVP in active development. The primary goal is to validate the core concept and provide a useful tool for the FPL community.
